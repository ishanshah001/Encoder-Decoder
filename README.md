# Encoder-Decoder
#### A program, packman, that takes two command line arguments and either encodes the content of the first, un-encoded file into a second, encoded file, or decodes the content of the first, encoded file into a second, decoded file using Huffman's algorithm.
#### The program decides whether to encode or decode based on the presence or absence of a magic number at the start of the file content.
#### The source alphabet to encode is simply 8-bit bytes. This alphabet includes both ASCII and binary files, in which the bytes do not have an ASCII interpretation.
